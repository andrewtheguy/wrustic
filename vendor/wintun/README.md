# Vendored Wintun driver

`wintun-amd64.dll` is embedded into the wrustic binary by `src/smb/tun.rs`
(`include_bytes!`) when built with `--features smb-tun`, and written to the
user's config directory at runtime so wrustic ships as a single executable.

The DLL hash is pinned in `WINTUN_DLL_SHA256` and asserted by
`embedded_driver_matches_its_pinned_hash`, so this file cannot be replaced
without the build failing. It is also re-verified on disk before it is ever
loaded as code.

To update: download the new archive, confirm its SHA2-256 against wintun.net,
confirm the Authenticode signature on the extracted DLL, replace this file, and
update `WINTUN_DLL_SHA256` in `src/smb/tun.rs` to match. See `docs/smb-tun.md`.

`LICENSE.txt` is the Wintun *Prebuilt Binaries License*. §3(d) permits
redistribution alongside software that uses the driver only through the
documented API, which is all wrustic does.
