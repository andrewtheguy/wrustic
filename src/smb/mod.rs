// A read-only SMB 2.1 server for a single restic snapshot.
//
// Why this exists: a snapshot is immutable, so exporting one over a real
// network filesystem needs no invalidation, no file-level locking and no write
// path. That makes a read-only server small enough to hand-roll, and a mounted
// filesystem is far more useful than a download link for browsing a backup.
//
// Repository-level coordination is a separate matter: "immutable" only holds
// while nothing prunes the repo, so a snapshot share holds restic's
// non-exclusive lock — the same lock `restic mount` takes — for its lifetime
// (see `start_snapshot_share` and docs/locking.md). Concurrent restic backups
// keep working; a concurrent prune/forget is blocked with restic's ordinary
// "repository is already locked" error until the share stops.
//
// Scope, deliberately: SMB 2.1 only, mandatory NTLMv2 authentication, mandatory
// signing, no encryption, loopback by default. 2.1 is the newest dialect that
// avoids pre-auth integrity hashes, negotiate contexts and AES-GCM; NTLMv2 plus
// signing is the floor Windows 11 24H2 accepts, and all three client platforms
// support it, so there is no guest path to keep working. Every write command is
// refused at the protocol level in addition to there being no code that could
// perform one.
//
// A mount is for browsing a snapshot, not for restoring or running one:
// symlinks cannot survive SMB 2.1 anyway, so nothing here pretends to be a
// faithful copy of the original tree. Files come out 0444 and directories 0555
// — on Linux and macOS from the mode options in the mount commands below (SMB
// 2.1 carries no POSIX mode of its own), and on Windows from the READONLY
// attribute plus a CREATE that refuses FILE_EXECUTE on files.
//
// Mount it with — each prompts for the password, which is never passed as an
// argument: a command line is readable by every other process while it runs,
// and lands in shell (or console) history afterwards.
